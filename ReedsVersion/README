These scripts were updated on 8/14/2019.

Fixes:
  - sped up "generate_decoys" scripts so they calculate Tanimoto between ligands versus decoys,
    not all molecules vs all molecules - this was done by incorporating JK's scripts
  - in the SMILES pipeline, the Tanimoto calculation between all ligands and the property-matched
    decoys in all subdirectories is performed first, then protonation is done. This may speed up
    the calculation, if the property-matched decoys returned are similar to ligands.
  - The "filter_decoys" script only calculates Tanimoto between decoys now
  - Protomer SMILES for decoys are reported when using the SMILES pipeline (generate_decoys_with_SMILES.py)
  - Decoys are sorted by Tc to all ligands, and then assigned to each ligand now. Before, they were sorted by molecular weight
